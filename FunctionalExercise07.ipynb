This neccessiataes a fundamental shift in how the analysis is designed in terms of program structure. This however does not sacrifice any functionality in terms of possible analyses methods in comparison with the widely used object oriented method of writing Analyses."

To optimize our analysis we will use the monte-carlo data to make sure that the analysis is not artificially tuned to find a peak in the real data but only find a peak that we put there (in the simulation). If the peak is not there in the data we can be sure that our analysis would have picked it up and therefore can say if there was a peak at the predicted location or not without having to worry about if the analysis was skewed to find the peak because you thought there ought to be one and then made the analysis to produce data to fit your conclusion.\n",

    "As you can see the some columns have been parsed as strings. We need to fix that and convert the strings to lists of floating point numbers. Depending on a few things there are (more or less) two approaches that can be used to perform this step and all further steps of the data processing.\n",
    "1. The first method is using a functional programming style. This means that as a first step a set of functions are applied that act on one single event, taking in the entire event, somehow modifying it and then returning that modified event. These functions will then be used with pythons internal filter and map methods. This is a data-flow centric approach where, using map and filter, the functions are combined into a data pipeline and then the data is fed through the pipeline. It uses iterators as central objects for the creation of the pipeline that then feed the data through one element at a time. This document will focus on the this first approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second method is an approach that is more like a spreadsheet. The original data is still kept and if a quantity needs to be calculated or some subset of the data needs to be altered for each and every event (such as the parsing of the string into an array of floats) then either a column is modified or a new column is added to the table. Further more the data in the table can be aggregated in various ways to \"answer questions about the data\" (that was using data science speak). This approach does not really think about \"flows\" of data but treats everything like a giant spreadsheet."

    "# The functional / data-flow approach\n",
    "---\n",
    "So for this part I will demonstrate the data-flow approach using python iterators and the filter/map functions from python's core\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we need to transform the data of the pandas dataframe into an iterator so that we can apply all further operations using map and filter (and a few other neat functions that are provided in the `itertools` module of the python standard library (these are a few functions that do neat things with iterators))\n",
    "\n",
    "But you legitamely might be asking what an iterator actually is. And the technical answer to that question is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">An iterator is something you can call next() on as in `next(something)`. By definition that something is an iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me note that `next()` is not an attribute call here but an [built in function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) of python. This is part of what makes iterators somewhat special in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In less technical terms, an iterator is something that can produce a value of a certain structure (or type more precicely). That means if we have the iterator `something` and `next(something)` produces a `tuple(int, float, str)` then any subsequent calls should produce a `tuple(int, float, str)`. I say should here because there are exceptions to this but that will not be discussed here. If the iterator can't return anything anymore it raises the `StopIteration` exception, which essentially signals to the pipeline that no more data is coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are essentially abstractions of lists. And sure enough a list in python is an iterator (anthing that can be used in a `for` loop is an iterator because 'under the hood' the for loop goes through an iterator one by one and applies whatever is specified in the for loop to each item it gets from the iterator. The difference is that iterators don't neccesarily need to be lists, they just need to know how to produce the next item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a typical thing that python newcomers tend to write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "for i in range(len(data)):\n",
    "    data[i] += 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we could think that `range(len(data))` is a list but it is not, as discussed it is an iterator. because range knows when to stop and how to generate the next item from the current one (in this case it adds `1` to the current count) and returns it when `next()` is called on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar thing can be done for random numbers, instead of fillig an array with random numbers an iterator can be used because the function that generates the random numbers must allways know how to generate the next random number from some internal state. So we could generate the next number exactly and only when we need it. This eliminates the need to keep massive amounts of random numbers in the main memory and makes programs a lot more recource efficient (with some caveats I won't go into). Essentially the only thing we need to be able to do is somehow 'pause' the random number function right after generating a random number and hit the proverbial 'play' button as soon as we want the next number and hit 'pause' again right after the number was generated. This way of writing a function has already been done for many things in python so I won't go into it here [they are called 'generators' just fyi](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information you can also read [this document on functional programming in python](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing this enables is to wrap iterators around each other and we will allways get back an interator. This is what the `map` and `filter` methods do.\n",
    "Let's look at what happens when we have an example iterator (I'll use a simple list here as the iterator but it can easily be something different as long as it is an iterator) that returns a tuple of 3 numbers and that is wrapped with some map and filter methods."

    "## Building analysis pipelines\n",
    "To facilitate code reuse it is useful to structure these transformations and filters from single transformations into a structure I'll call a pipeline. A pipeline either produces a certain filtered and amended subset of the initial data or generates the answer to a question like the properties of some quantity. This pipeline can then be called with any data that fits the input format of the first tranformation in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrary pipeline will generally consist of 3 steps.\n",
    "1. Format the data into the form that the pipeline (and subsequently you as the programmer) can work with best. This is essentially what we have been doing so far. We have parsed the strings and then reformed the data into a structure that is most useful/efficient/intuitive (depending on the needs).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter the data: The next step in any analysis is to filter out all data that does not fit the requirements. This should be done as early as possible to avoid doing expensive computations on data that would be thrown out anyway. So the Idea is to start with the cheapest calculations that eliminate the largest amounts of data form the sample that was loaded into the front of the pipeline (think of this in the same sense as the refinement process of crude oil into it's destillates). If the refinery would perform a specific process to a compond that would later be dumped anyway the refinery just used up a lot of energy for nothing and needs larger processing facilities than would actually be neccesary (this analogy maps pretty much exactly to data processing, the crude oil being the inputs and the destillates the outputs. The energy would be the energy consumed by the computers during the processing and processing data at a specific throughput would require less compute power the more efficient it is).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the data has been filtered to the smallest possible dataset the expensive calculations (like the reconstruction of ancestor particles like B and D mesons and in this case hopefully the two Z bosons and finally the higgs boson) can commence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the pipeline can then be used to visualize the behaviour or relationships of the quantity of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining pipelines\n",
    "The nice thing about this approach is, that the results of one pipeline can be used as input for the next pipeline. So if new data becomes available to answer a particular question that allready has a pipline that can produce an answer the only thing that needs to be done is to write a pipeline that transforms the data from this particular source into a format that the original pipeline can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task may however also involve some amount of filtering besides simple transformation and in that case the reqirements on the input data need to be known for any pipeline. Again these requirements don't only apply to the format of the data but also the ranges of values the data is allowed to take on to guarantee that the pipeline will work properly. "

The function that is passed to filter needs to return `True` if the value should be accepted and `False` if it should be rejected. As you can see our `pt_min` function does exactly that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing I wanted to talk about briefly is the [lambda](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions) expression, that was used in the lepton filter. `lambda` functions are a sort of short hand for defining functions. As you can see the function is not very long, it fits into less than one line. The `lambda` function ends at the `,` and is equivalent to the following 'proper' function definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def filter_leptons(x, min_pt):\n",
    "    return lepton['pt'] > min_pt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few noteworthy differences though:\n",
    "- A `lambda` function does not need a name. I have therefore given the previous equivalent function a fitting name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- lambda functions also 'capture their environment' that means lambda functions can use all variables that would be available inside the scope where the lambda function was defined (in the case of the `pt_min` function, the labmda expression there did not need to be passed the `min_pt` value as it automatically had access to it, whereas it needs to be passed explicitly to the `filter_leptons` function so it can be used inside the function body. The particulars of this kind of behavior (which is called 'scoping') are a bit more tricky and will not be covered further here.\n",

   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "So when we take a look at the `pt_min` method, we can see that the signature of the function (the signature is the word for how the function 'looks' from the outside. So the  signature of the function is the name together with type and sequence of input parameters and the output parameters of the function) still does not fit the requirements for the `filter` method. We subsequently need to wrap this function somehow. This is similar but not quite the same to how we wrapped the function to calculate the `pt` for each lepton in an event. This time we have to wrap the function that takes an event together with a parameter to filter the event by. There are a few methods to do this. We shal talk about these now.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tuple (un)wrapping**: Here the values neede are packed into a tuple and unpacked inside the wrapper function, passed to the function being wrapped (in this case `pt_min`) and then proceed as before. This obviously neccessitates the definition of a 'wrapper' function. This function could be defined in the fillowing way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pt_min_wrapper(event_with_pt_min_tuple):\n",
    "    event, min_pt = event_with_pt_min_tuple\n",
    "    return pt_min(event, min_pt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this method is that this makes the call of the filter a bit more complicated, as it is now neccessary to construct a `min_pt` object for each and every event that all have to be identical and combine the two objects into a tuple as follows `(event,     min_pt)`. The iterators and functions from the itertools can help here. The call would subsequently look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filter(pt_min_wrapper, zip(events, itertools.cycle(min_pt)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check out what [cycle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle) does at the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using a `lambda`**: with a `lambda` all of that effort can be avoided. The lambda method acts as the wrapper, but because it has access to it's environment (the place where `min_pt` is defined) the `min_pt` argument is implicitly copied as part of the funcion call. This is (in my humble oppinion) the far more elegant solution. We will use this method when we filter the stream after the next text section"

In this case we are analysing the decay of the Higgs Boson into four leptons via two $Z$ bosons. We are not considering anything else here so we don't have to look for photons or jets or anything of that sort.\n",

This could create multiple copies of the same event (at most one per pipeline bringing the total to 3) As we have kept the ID of each event we should not forget to then cross check if one event ended up being counted for two different decay channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you however read the [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.7235.pdf), you will find that the authors chose to first limit the electrons in each event to electrons with a $p_T > 7 \\text{ [GeV]}$ and $\\left|\\eta\\right| < 2.5$. The muons considered for each event also have to satisfy $p_T > 5\\text{ [GeV]}$ and $\\left|\\eta\\right| < 2.4$ So let's define these parameters here.\n",

The `max_dxy` and `max_dz` are quantities related to the impact parameter and describe the point of closest approach of the lepton track to the reconstructed vertex. If the lepton is to far away, we should not consider it part of the vertex and therefore discard it."

It is therefore important to think about what parameters will probably be varied often and expose them to the outside. But be careful, simply exposing every parameter may become confusing (if also maybe neccesary). You will have to decide that for every pipeline and analysis you build at your discretion and taste.

    "\n",
    "- we write two analysis pipelines that go from the input data in the pandas dataframe filter out everything except for the events matching the requirements to be in one of the three channels. So in effect the Pipeline is run thrice, once for each channel we want to look at. This has the drawback that we need to perform the parsing and reformatting, as well as the calculation of the transverse momentum thrice, once for each analysis. In our case the calculations and transformations where not particularly expensive, it is however imaginable that a situation arises where the analyses differ in a later stage where, for example, the reconstruction has allready taken place and used up large amount of CPU time and energy to run the computers. Doing that thrice is qite literaly an expensive thing to do (as in paying the power bills at the end of the month).\n",
    "\n",
    "- we could split the stream of data into three streams with identical copies. The first stream goes into the filter for the 2el2mu events, the second into the 4mu channel filter and the third into the 4el channel filter. This is exactly what the `itertools.tee` fuction allows us to do.\n",

This allows us to quickly verify that the program actually did what it was supposed to and gives us a bit of a 'feel' for our data. This will be implemented as a filter that only selects the data that we want to plot and possibly a mapping to bring the filtered data into a shape that is useful for plotting. Then all that is needed to be done is to assemble everything in a `list` and then we can plot the quantity(ies) of interest. So let's implement a simple hist for a quantity of the leptons in each event.\n",

We also get a problem when we get an empty array (which happened to me when I was writing this, which is why I know this (the magic of hindsight).

    "If we take a look at the second plot we can see two distict bumps one at 5 and one around 7. The fact that there are no more entries under 5 is clear, as they got filtered out. However there is another spike around 7 that was not there before. This is due to the filteing of the muons starting at 7GeV. Because of this it would be nice to see the fraction of electrons vs muons in the histogram. For that we need to adapt the histogram to show stacked histogarms and we need to filter out electrons and muons. So let's do that."

Because we can split the stream off from any point in the pipeline, we can plot the same quantitiy over various steps without any extra code (except for say data conversion code if the format changed during the analysis process). We could also extract data from the pipeline with a similar mechanism and write it to disk rather than plot it. This is particularly useful if ther is a lot of data or there is allready a tool available to handle that aspect. It could technically also be piped directly into the tool via the operating system, but I'd generally not do that as it has a host of timing and buffer related issues that comes with it, however it still is an a possibility."

When we look at the signal however we hope to see that most of our simulated signal passes the tests without loosing to many events.

    "# The pros and cons of using Python\n",
    "After you have now seen the power of functional programming in python I would like to discuss with you the different aspects of using python for such a task. We have demonstrated that such a thing *can* be done with python, but that does not mean it *must* be done in python. There are powers to this method that python simply can't use because of how python itself works and I will go into the most important two here and discuss alternatives to python and their pros and cons in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wan't to warn you here, that I am somewhat oppinionated what this topic is concerned. I don't want to tell you what to do or not to do. This method however has worked for me time and time again and 'just works' in nearly every data processing task I have encountered. Compunding this is the efficiencies that can be acheived when using not only the right methods but right tools. These things are important to me but not need to be important to you which is why you may come to a vastly different conclusion than me and that is totally fine. You (hopefully) make concious choices what tools to use for the job and how to go about your business. This part is meant to give a (maybe differing) perspective and offer reasons for that perspective. In the end it is up to you to choose how to do the things you want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly I would like to stress that there are different tasks that profit from a different view on the data and data processing. Most namely here is the training of neural networks. As you may have noticed the previous code has mostly been focused on single events and the whole Idea of pipelines is that there is a queue of events and the events are fed into the front of the pipeline the pipeline produces some desired output from the input, if neccessary by aggregating the individual events at different stages. Neural networks need to see all the data 'simultaneously' during training to be able to see patterns and correlations that would go unnoticed where it only to look at one event at a time. This is where a 'column oriented view', so a view that emphesizes a single quantity for all events (if you would group events as rows and the properties of such an event as columns (like the dataframe in the beginning) it is understandable where the term 'column oriented view' comes from) is more helpful. For me it is important to emphesize that the task of training a neural network (at least to me) is a different task of designing a data processing pipeline and needs to be treated with different considerations. This 'functional style' is not and should not be the cure to all data processing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that the job of a scientist mostly involves the development of ideas and not the production of a ready to use product (like a command line tool or a usable library). Scientists tend to use computers as tools to prove that their Idear works and as soon as it does a paper gets written and the code (at least this seems to be the case that I see) is abandoned afterwards.\n",
    "I have some problems with this because of the way I think about things and the habbits I have developed. This is not to say that this practice is not a valid way of conducting science. I just think that too much is 'implied by the author' meaning that the author has (in my oppinion that is) too many assumptions about her/his audience. I don't like implied things because I tend to think about things differently than others (and have done so for a long time) and this means that I often don't fit the assumptions of other authors and have to work hard to then figure out what I need to know to be able to understand what I am reading. This is why in science especially I prefer explicit statements and clean readable and most importantly understandable code because it is vital to transport the Idea with all of it's possible inticacies.\n",
    "I beleive science has the duty to communicate it's findings as clearly and understandably as possible. But as this is not the reality most of us live in (I mean there are allways new papers to publish and the quality of a paper is not neccesarilt measured in it's approachableness but in it's accuracy and conciceness (which implies prior knowledge in the field)) I can only try to convince you that the extra work put into explaining the Idea is worth your time. I beleive explicit writing comes with a host of benefits that I feel the 'need for speed' in the scientific realm and this 'first to publish gets the credit of discovery' thing disincentivies. Propper communication  of an idea is for me just as important as the idea itself. As scientsist it is all we do, that is think up Ideas and communicate them to others.\n",
    "I have tried and would like to see effort put in the clear communication of the ideas expressed in computer code. This is facilitated by the use of clear and concice coding style and the use of a fitting way to express ones problem in code. I hope I have been explicit enough that you where able to understand the ideas expressed in the code above and that you have able to gain something from this document. I hope to have empowered you to do cool things with this and other ideas. In turn I hope that you will take the time (just as I have) to express your idears with the care they deserve so that they may bear fruit in others minds to collectively advance our understanding of the universe, one tiny step at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So after this lengthy motivation, on to the things I would like to say:\n",
    "## Python is not parallel\n",
    "As you have seen a pipeline is made up of many different steps, (i'll switch analogies now) like a conveir belt passing the item to be produces (I'll use a car for this) through various different stations, in a pipeline data is similarly passed through various different stations. Each station performs a specific action on the data (mostly it either calculates a new property for the value or filters the data depending on a specific property). As each station only acts uppon one item at a time and then passes that item along to the next station, in principle there is nothing stopping us from running our data processing job the same way Toyota or Ford run their factories, effectively having every station running in parrallel on different items. As long as each station knows where to pass the item to when it is done parallelisation is trivial. On top of that we have the benefit of being able to simply open up new assembly lines if we want more data to be processed (just as Ford or Tesla would open a new factory to be able to produce more cars). As long as there is enough input to feed the pipelines with, it is trivial to have the processing run on a million cores all at once. Using this mental model, python will quickly throw a wrench in the proverbial conveir belt.\n",

    "### Meet the GIL\n",
    "The GIL (or more commonly known as the <u>G</u>lobal <u>I</u>nterpreter <u>L</u>ock) is something that is baked deep into the core of python. Let me explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, there is no memory management in python. What is memmory management you ask, well here is a short summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memmory management is the task of tracking if a value or variable is still needed by the running program and dealing with the value in such a way that it is available when needed and that the variable has the value that the program would imply at the point where the value is needed. This is a bit more of a problem than it is made out to be. Memmory management means that all values and variables have to be tracked through the entire programs lifetime. It should not be able to alter the content of a variable in an unforseen way and last but not least the program should only need as much memmory as neccesary to perform it's task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second requirement is the triky one for python. Namely making sure the variable has the value that the programmer was expecting when they wrote the code. To help you understand I'll show you an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading this code (or imagine you are the programmer and you have just written these three lines of code) you would expect python to print the following line\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a truly parallel environment however two or more python interpreters would be operating on the same data. this means that if python interpreter no. 1 executes the first line and the python interpreter no. 2 executes the third line before no. 1 can execute the second line we would automatically get the following output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5\n",
    "42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first five comes from interpreter no. 2 that has executed line 1 and 2. Interpreter no. 1 is a bit slower (I'm not going into detail why here, so you best trust me that this is indeed something that is likely to happen, or at least likely enough that it can't be ignored) so during that time it was only able to execute line 1. Now No. 1 starts to interpret line 2 and starts working through the code of the `print` statement, but has not read the value of x yet. Now No 2. arrives at the third statement and changes `x` according to the statement to the value `42`. Now that No. 1 arrives at the point in the `print` statement where it wants to read `x` it does so but because No. 2 has allready changed the value to `42` it prints the second line of the output. After line 3 No. 2 is done and shuts down. No. 1 finally also sets `x` to `42` (which is redundant at this point but computers are stupid and do what they are told) and also shuts down.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this you can see that if truly parrallel programs operate on the same data mechanisms are needed to keep those kind of things from happening. As python does not force it's programmers to declare anything about the variables they are using and deducing that from the code written would mean that python could effectively not operate in interactive mode (along with a host of other considerations like execution time and so forth), the c-python developers opted for restricting a single running interpreter. So with that restriction the situation above is impossible as there can't be a No. 2 interpreter. On the other hand there cannot be a conveir belt style factory either as we cant have the different stations running in parallel. There is not enough 'snakes' to run such a factory (we have restricted ourselves to only one snake per factory after all). And if we need one snake to run one station, that means that only one station can be running in at a time (and the poor snake has to slither from one station to the next over and over (this is more of a real concern than you might think)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remedies for this while still using python\n",
    "We can't have multiple 'snakes' in one factory, or in more technical terms, we can't have more than one thread in a process. However the operating system is more than happy enough to let us start up more than one process. This means that we still can have more than one factory, each run by a single snake. That means that we still can spawn one process for each processor core of our computer, fully using the hardware that is there to be used. As we are effectively running the same program in parallel, we can increase performance by a factor equal to the number of cores available for the process. The thing is that moving data between processes and the snake slithering from one station to the next still causes delays that can be reduced, but the GIL is stopping us from being able to attack those problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python is... well... slow!\n",
    "Python has some really cool features: well built and supported libraries, a clean and readable syntax that gets out of your way, automatic memmory management (that restricts us as you have seen in the previous section), support for different programming styles, interactive sessions ....\n",
    "\n",
    "It however is also rather slow, especially when compared to high performance code that the kind of things like data analysis pipelines for terrabytes of data usually should be. This is due to a few things (that are also some of the strengths of python) Let me again explain ...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is ... interpreted\n",
    "The main reason that python is slow compared to languages like C or Fortran (frankly these examples are actually some of the fastest languages out there) and this is due to the fact that python is closer to a [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) than an 'actual' program. With 'actual' program I don't want to imply that writing python code is not programming, nor do I want to communicate that python is somehow less able (in terms of functionality as opposed to performance) than C or FORTRAN code. In terms of features, python clearly wins out against these languages (at least in my oppinion). "

This neccessiataes a fundamental shift in how the analysis is designed in terms of program structure. This however does not sacrifice any functionality in terms of possible analyses methods in comparison with the widely used object oriented method of writing Analyses."

    "The data described here is data generated by mote-carlo event generators and is split into background and signal simulation. To optimize our analysis we will use the monte-carlo data to make sure that the analysis is not artificially tuned to find a peak in the real data but only find a peak that we put there (in the simulation). If the peak is not there in the data we can be sure that our analysis would have picked it up and therefore can say if there was a peak at the predicted location or not without having to worry about if the analysis was skewed to find the peak because you thought there ought to be one and then made the analysis to produce data to fit your conclusion.\n",

    "As you can see the some columns have been parsed as strings. We need to fix that and convert the strings to lists of floating point numbers. Depending on a few things there are (more or less) two approaches that can be used to perform this step and all further steps of the data processing.\n",
    "1. The first method is using a functional programming style. This means that as a first step a set of functions are applied that act on one single event, taking in the entire event, somehow modifying it and then returning that modified event. These functions will then be used with pythons internal filter and map methods. This is a data-flow centric approach where, using map and filter, the functions are combined into a data pipeline and then the data is fed through the pipeline. It uses iterators as central objects for the creation of the pipeline that then feed the data through one element at a time. This document will focus on the this first approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second method is an approach that is more like a spreadsheet. The original data is still kept and if a quantity needs to be calculated or some subset of the data needs to be altered for each and every event (such as the parsing of the string into an array of floats) then either a column is modified or a new column is added to the table. Further more the data in the table can be aggregated in various ways to \"answer questions about the data\" (that was using data science speak). This approach does not really think about \"flows\" of data but treats everything like a giant spreadsheet."

    "# The functional / data-flow approach\n",
    "---\n",
    "So for this part I will demonstrate the data-flow approach using python iterators and the filter/map functions from python's core\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we need to transform the data of the pandas dataframe into an iterator so that we can apply all further operations using map and filter (and a few other neat functions that are provided in the `itertools` module of the python standard library (these are a few functions that do neat things with iterators)\n",
    "\n",
    "But you legitamely might be asking what an iterator actually is. And the technical answer to that question is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">An iterator is something you can call next() on as in `next(something)`. By definition that something is an iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me note that `next()` is not an attribute call here but an [built in function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) of python. This is part of what makes iterators somewhat special in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In less technical terms, an iterator is something that can produce a value of a certain structure (or type more precicely). That means if we have the iterator `something` and `next(something)` produces a `tuple(int, float, str)` then any subsequent calls should produce a `tuple(int, float, str)`. I say should here because there are exceptions to this but that will not be discussed here. If the iterator can't return anything anymore it raises the `StopIteration` exception, which essentially signals to the pipeline that no more data is coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are essentially abstractions of lists. And sure enough a list in python is an iterator (anthing that can be used in a `for` loop is an iterator because 'under the hood' the for loop goes through an iterator one by one and applies whatever is specified in the for loop to each item it gets from the iterator. The difference is that iterators don't neccesarily need to be lists, they just need to know how to produce the next item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a typical thing that python newcomers tend to write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "for i in range(len(data)):\n",
    "    data[i] += 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we could think that `range(len(data))` is a list but it is not, as discussed it is an iterator. because range knows when to stop and how to generate the next item from the current one (in this case it adds `1` to the current count) and returns it when `next()` is called on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar thing can be done for random numbers, instead of fillig an array with random numbers an iterator can be used because the function that generates the random numbers must allways know how to generate the next random number from some internal state. So we could generate the next number exactly and only when we need it. This eliminates the need to keep massive amounts of random numbers in the main memory and makes programs a lot more recource efficient (with some caveats I won't go into). Essentially the only thing we need to be able to do is somehow 'pause' the random number function right after generating a random number and hit the proverbial 'play' button as soon as we want the next number and hit 'pause' again right after the number was generated. This way of writing a function has been done for many things in python allready so I won't go into it here [they are called 'generators' just fyi](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information you can also read [this document on functional programming in python](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing this enables is to wrap iterators around each other and we will allways get back an interator. This is what the `map` and `filter` methods do.\n",
    "Let's look at what happens when we have an example iterator that returns a tuple of 3 numbers and that is wrapped with some map and filter methods."

    "## Building analysis pipelines\n",
    "To facilitate code reuse it is useful to structure these transformations and filters from single transformations into a structure I'll call a pipeline. A pipeline either produces a certain filtered and amended subset of the initial data or generates the answer to a question like the properties of some quantity. This pipeline can then be called with any data that fits the input format of the first tranformation in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrary pipeline will generally consist of 3 steps.\n",
    "1. Format the data into the form that the pipeline (and subsequently you as the programmer) can work with best. This is essentially what we have been doing so far. We have parsed the strings and then reformed the data into a structure that is most useful/efficient/intuitive (depending on the needs).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter the data: The next step in any analysis is to filter out all data that does not fit the requirements. This should be done as early as possible to avoid doing expensive computations on data that would be thrown out anyway. So the Idea is to start with the cheapest calculations that eliminate the largest amounts of data form the sample that was loaded into the front of the pipeline (think of this in the same sense as the refinement process of crude oil into it's destillates). If the refinery would perform a specific process to a compond that would later be dumped anyway the refinery just used up a lot of energy for nothing and needs larger processing facilities than would actually be neccesary (this analogy maps pretty much exactly to data processing, the crude oil being the inputs and the destillates the outputs. The energy would be the energy consumed by the computers during the processing and processing data at a specific throughput would require less compute power the more efficient it is).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the data has been filtered to the smallest possible dataset the expensive calculations (like the reconstruction of ancestor particles like B and D mesons and in this case hopefully the two Z bosons and finally the higgs boson) can commence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the pipeline can then be used to visualize the behaviour or relationships of the quantity of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining pipelines\n",
    "The nice thing about this approach is, that the results of one pipeline can be used as input for the next pipeline. So if new data becomes available to answer a particular question that allready has a pipline that can produce an answer the only thing that needs to be done is to write a pipeline that transforms the data from this particular source into a format that the original pipeline can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task may however also involve some amount of filtering besides simple transformation and in that case the reqirements on the input data need to be known for any pipeline. Again these requirements don't only apply to the format of the data but also the ranges of values the data is allowed to take on to guarantee that the pipeline will work properly. "

The function that is passed to filter needs to return `True` if the value should be accepted and `False` if it should be rejected. As you can see our `pt_min` function does exactly that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing I wanted to talk about briefly is the [lambda](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions) expression, that was used in the lepton filter. `lambda` functions are a sort of short hand for defining functions. As you can see the function is not very long, it fits into less than one line. The `lambda` function ends at the `,` and is equivalent to the following 'proper' function definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def filter_leptons(x, min_pt):\n",
    "    return lepton['pt'] > min_pt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few noteworthy differences though:\n",
    "- A `lambda` function does not need a name. I have therefore given the previous equivalent function a fitting name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- lambda functions also 'capture their environment' that means lambda functions can use all variables that would be available inside the scope where the lambda function was defined (in the case of the `pt_min` function, the labmda expression there did not need to be passed the `min_pt` value as it automatically had access to it, whereas it needs to be passed explicitly to the `filter_leptons` function so it can be used inside the function body. The particulars of this kind of behavior (which is called 'scoping') are a bit more tricky and will not be covered further here.\n",
    "\n",
    "---"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "So when we take a look at the `pt_min` method, we can see that the signature of the function (the signature is the word for how the function 'looks' from the outside. So the  signature of the function is the name together with type and sequence of input parameters and the output parameters of the function) still does not fit the requirements for the `filter` method. We subsequently need to wrap this function somehow. This is similar but not quite the same to how we wrapped the function to calculate the `pt` for each lepton in an event. This time we have to wrap the function that takes an event together with a parameter to filter the event by. There are a few methods to do this. We shal talk about these now.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tuple (un)wrapping**: Here the values neede are packed into a tuple and unpacked inside the wrapper function, passed to the function being wrapped (in this case `pt_min`) and then proceed as before. This obviously neccessitates the definition of a 'wrapper' function. This function could be defined in the fillowing way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pt_min_wrapper(event_with_pt_min_tuple):\n",
    "    event, min_pt = event_with_pt_min_tuple\n",
    "    return pt_min(event, min_pt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this method is that this makes the call of the filter a bit more complicated, as it is now neccessary to construct a `min_pt` object for each and every event that all have to be identical and combine the two objects into a tuple as follows `(event,     min_pt)`. The iterators and functions from the itertools can help here. The call would subsequently look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filter(pt_min_wrapper, zip(events, itertools.cycle(min_pt)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check out what [cycle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle) does at the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using a `lambda`**: with a `lambda` all of that effort can be avoided. The lambda method acts as the wrapper, but because it has access to it's environment (the place where `min_pt` is defined) the `min_pt` argument is implicitly copied as part of the funcion call. This is (in my humble oppinion) the far more elegant solution. We will use this method when we filter the stream after the next text section"

    "Imagine the following: You have multiple questions you would like to get answers to by analyzing the data.\n",
    "The problem now is that the one answer needs at least four leptons to have a transverse impulse of at least $p_{t_{min}}$ and the other answer needs these events that where rejected to be able to calculate the answer to our second question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to get those two answers there are a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we write two analysis pipelines that go from the input data in the pandas dataframe to the answer. This has the drawback that we need to perform the parsing and reformatting, as well as the calculation of the transverse momentum twice, once for each analysis. In our case the calculations and transformations where not particularly expensive, it is however easy to imagine a situation where the analyses differ in a later stage where for example reconstruction have allready taken place and used up large amount of CPU time and energy to run the computers. Doing that twice is qite literaly an expensive thing to do (as in paying the power bills at the end of the month).\n",
    "\n",
    "- we could split the stream of data into two streams with identical copies. The first stream goes into the `pt_min` filter and the other can be used in a different analysis. This is exactly what the `itertools.tee` fuction allows us to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we shal split the stream into two streams, one for the pt_min filter and beyond and one stream to do something else with at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the stream would also allow us to take a 'live' look at our data being processed. We could split the stream at various points in the pipeline and plot out relevant quantities. This can not only be useful for following the analysis but also in finding bugs in the code, as the plots and histograms should quickly show discrepencies between expected an actual result."

    "This is also why I used the `len(list(iterator))` call. the `list` function turns the iterator back into a list by calling next on the iterator until it raises the `StopIteration` exception and stores the values the iterator returns in a list in the order it got them from the iterator. Subsequently an iterator does not know it's length, but a list of course does so we need the list before we can call `len` to determin how many events made it into the different channels."
